# ImageQuilt

A simple implementation of the Image Quilting algorithm from Efros & Freeman paper in C++

It is currently extremely unoptimized and naive implementation.

Sample text input:

![Alt text](ImageQuilt/input/text.bmp "Title")

Output with 64 tilesize, 8 number of tiles per dim, 16 pixels overlap, 0.1 error:

![Alt text](ImageQuilt/output/output.bmp "Title")
